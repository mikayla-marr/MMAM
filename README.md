# MMAM
This project explores motor vehicle collisions in New York City using historical crash data. We analyze crash trends by borough, time of day, and ZIP code, and assess the proportion of crashes occurring at intersections versus non-intersection locations. The goal is to identify patterns and risk areas to inform urban safety improvements and traffic planning.
